# Styling static pages

We have our first static page, but it's fairly basic. Would be really cool
to add some styles to it.

If you look at our `App` component, you will notice two things about CSS:

* The `App.css` import statement
* Using the `className` prop on the `App` component

:::note className instead of class

The reason for using `className` in React instead of `class` is due to the native
way we handle the DOM API. when manipulating the DOM via JavaScript, you don't
use `class`, but `className`. Besides, `class` is a protected keyword in
JavaScript which is meant to create JavaScript classes.

:::

```jsx title="./src/App.js" jsx {2,9}
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import AboutPage from './components/static/AboutPage';

function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Reactgram</h1>
      <Router>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <AboutPage/>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The way a `create-react-app` works by default is to allow us to import
CSS files directly into our component files. During the app bundling, which
is the process of collecting all files, transform them in the right order
and generate a final production-ready bundle to be deployed. This is a super
valid approach to write CSS for your React apps, but there is a new trendy way
of keep your CSS even more closer to your component. It's called [__CSS-in-js__](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#what-is-css-in-js),
and we will be taking this approach here.

The way CSS-in-js works is that instead of writing individual CSS files and keep
them out of range from our component, we can actually write CSS directly into our
JavaScript file, keeping style and component both very close together. This method
allows us to go a step further, enabling us to perform conditional styling based on
our component state. We will see that in practice along the book.

## Using styled-components

The library we are going to use to accomplish CSS-in-js is called [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
Let's go ahead and install it with the following command:

```shell
yarn add styled-components
```

:::caution Important
Whenever we install a new dependency, we must restart our dev server.
To perform a restart, press `ctrl+c` to stop it and enter `yarn start` to start it again.
:::

## Removing existing CSS files

Since we will be writing our CSS inside our JavaScript files, we don't need CSS files
anymore. So just go ahead and delete `./src/App.css` and `./src/index.css`. Notice that 
the app will start working. It's because those files we just deleted are being imported 
by some of our JavaScript files, so lets remove those imports.

* Remove the `import './App.css';` line from `./src/App.js`
* Remove the `className="App"` from the `App` component
* Remove the `import './index.css';` line from `./src/index.js`

Once you remove those lines and save the files, your app should work again, although the
styles will be the defaults from the browser now since we are not applying any at the moment.

## Creating a layout component

Now create a file called `StaticLayout.js` inside of `./src/components/static` with the
following code:

```jsx title="./src/static/StaticLayout.js"
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StaticLayout = styled.div`
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
    justify-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 935px;
`;

export {
  StaticLayout
};
```

Now we created a React component which isn't a normal JavaScript function anymore.
What is going on here? This is what the `styled.div` function call is doing for us.
It creates a React component with the CSS written inside the multiline string we passed
to it. The `.div` function is creating a `div` element with all the CSS passed in,
so whenever we use the `StaticLayout` component, it will wrap all other children 
components and let you apply any CSS rule down the component tree.

You don't have to worry about the details right now, just that if you need to render a
styled `p` tag, you can use `styled.p` to created that for you. The same rule applies
to `a`, `button` and every other HTML tag available to us.

Now Let go to our `AboutPage.js` and use our new component we just created.

```jsx title="./src/static/AboutPage.js" {2,7,15}
import React from 'react';
import { StaticLayout } from './StaticLayout';

function AboutPage() {

  return(
    <StaticLayout>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>
        React is the most popular frontend library on the market. Built by Facebook, 
        it is based on functional components which are updated automatically when a 
        state update occurs. Designed around a declarative architecture, components 
        created in React are much easier to build, debug and maintain.
      </p>
    </StaticLayout>
  )

}

export default AboutPage;
```

We imported our newly created `StaticLayout` component, removed the top level `div` and 
wrapped our content with `StaticLayout`. Go ahead and check your browser, you should see
something similar to this:

![About page with styled-components](/img/starting-reactgram/about-page-styled-components.png)

Now go ahead and use the developer tools from your browser to see what was really rendered
in the DOM. You will notice that our About Page content was wrapped in a div with some random
CSS classes.

![About page with styled div](/img/starting-reactgram/about-page-styled-div.png)

This is what `styled-component` is doing for us. The reason for having random CSS class names
is actually by design. This is a feature to create scoped CSS which are applied to our
components only, avoiding the CSS rules to be leaked outside of its boundaries.

Notice that our CSS rules were applied successfully, although we didn't finish our styles
yet. Lets make our page look nicer by editing the `StaticLayout` component once again.

```jsx {13-17}
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StaticLayout = styled.div`
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
    justify-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 935px;
    width: 100%;

    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica,
      Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
`;

export {
  StaticLayout
};
```

We added some system fonts to it so it will look nicer, but notice that the header
`Reactgram`, just above our component doesn't change it's font at all. This is again
due to the fact that styled-components scoped our CSS rules to `StaticLayout` and its
children only.

![About page with styled components scoped](/img/starting-reactgram/styled-components-scoped.png)

But would be cool to have some global styling applied automatically isn't? Stuff like
`font-family` and `font-size` is usually something you want to have configured in one
single place and distributed down to other DOM elements.
