# Sharing components across pages

In the previous section, we implemented our `Footer` component. We also rendered
it within our `StaticLayout` component, which will enable us to share it across
different pages. Lets see it practice now.

## Creating our Help page

Let's go ahead and create a file called `HelpPage.js` at `src/static` with the
following content:

```jsx title="./src/static/HelpPage.js"
import { StaticLayout } from './StaticLayout';

function HelpPage() {

  return(
    <StaticLayout>
      <h1>Help Page</h1>
      <p>
        Reactgram is an app created while reading the <a href="https://reactgram.dev">reactgram book</a>
        {' '}which doesn't provide any support. But feel free to ask questions via
        our <a href="https://github.com/brunojppb/reactgram/issues">Github Issues page.</a>
      </p>
    </StaticLayout>
  )

}

export default HelpPage;
```

We took a similar approach like we did for the `AboutPage` component, so there is
probably nothing new here. But just creating the `HelpPage` component isn't enough
to be able to see it in our app. We must create route for it.

Now let's go ahead and edit `src/App.js` with the following content:

```jsx title="./src/App.js" {4,18-20}
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import { GlobalStyle } from './components/GlobalStyles';
import AboutPage from './components/static/AboutPage';
import HelpPage from './components/static/HelpPage';

function App() {

  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle/>
      <h1>Reactgram</h1>
      <Router>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <AboutPage/>
          </Route>
          <Route path="/help">
            <HelpPage/>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Here we added a new route for our help page in the same way we did for our about
page.

Now head back to your browser and try the `help` link on the footer. It should
show you the `HelpPage` component.

## Sharing the footer across the entire App

If you go back to the homepage at `localhost:3000`, you will notice that we don't
render the footer there. This is because we are only rendering the footer within
the `StaticLayout` component. Let's change this so we can show the footer across
our whole app.

Head back to `src/components/static/StaticLayout.js` and remove the references to
the `Footer` component. Your code should look like this:

```jsx title="./src/components/static/StaticLayout.js"
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StaticLayoutWrapper = styled.div`
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
    justify-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 935px;
    width: 100%;
`;

export const StaticLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return(
    <>
      <StaticLayoutWrapper>
        {children}
      </StaticLayoutWrapper>
    </>
  )
}
```

Now we need to place the `Footer` component in our `App` component so it will
render the footer across all pages. Remember that the `App` component works as
the main container for our app, which will always be rendered across all pages
at all times.

Notice that we also have a `Link` to the about page in our `App`. We don't need
that anymore because our `Footer` component already includes a link to the about
page. So we can also delete that.

Head back to `src/App.js` and render the `Footer` within the `Router` component.

```jsx title="./src/App.js" {2,22}
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';
import { Footer } from './components/common/Footer';
import { GlobalStyle } from './components/GlobalStyles';
import AboutPage from './components/static/AboutPage';
import HelpPage from './components/static/HelpPage';

function App() {

  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle/>
      <h1>Reactgram</h1>
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <AboutPage/>
          </Route>
          <Route path="/help">
            <HelpPage/>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
        <Footer/>
      </Router>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now head back to your browser and open `localhost:3000`. You should see a very
empty homepage. It includes the app name and the footer, but bear with me, we will
add a more interesting homepage soon.

Now try to click on the `about` and `help` links. You should see the content switching
just like normal web pages do.

## Adding the Privacy Page

To add the privacy page, you have to follow the exact same steps we took for adding the
help page. I will leave the page component code here as reference and will leave
the privacy page for you do add by yourself as an exercise.

``` jsx title="./src/components/static/PrivacyPage.js"
import { StaticLayout } from './StaticLayout';

function PrivacyPage() {

  return(
    <StaticLayout>
      <h1>Privacy Page</h1>
      <p>
        At Reactgram, accessible from https://reactgram.dev, one of our main
        priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document
        contains types of information that is collected and recorded by
        Reactgram and how we use it.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        This is an app created for educational purpose only and we do not collect
        any personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Consent</h2>

      <p>
        By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree
        to its Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
    </StaticLayout>
  )

}

export default PrivacyPage;
```

And here is how it should look like once you finish this exercise and visit `localhost:3000/privacy`

## Wrapping up

In the previous sections we managed to create several pages using React components.
We also saw how we can compose components together by rendering bigger components like
`StaticLayout` and reusing it across several pages.

We also saw how to create routes in our app for static pages and how to use
`styled-components` to write CSS directly into our JS files, enabling us to create
wrapper components with custom styles.

In the next section, we will start building our user registration flow and during
that moment we will explore form elements and how they work in React.
