# Shared components with footer

We have got our first static page up and running. We added some styles and things 
are starting to look good. There is now one thing that pretty common in web apps
which is a footer.

There is usually this shared component that is shown across all pages, no matter
where you are in the app. So lets go and built it.

## Creating our footer component

Lets start by creating a folder called `common` under `components`. with in it let's
create a file called `Footer.js` with the following content:

```jsx title="./src/components/common/Footer.js"
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const FooterWrapper = styled.footer`
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 900px;
  margin: auto;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;

  ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
    li {
      display: inline-block;
      margin: 5px 10px;
      font-size: 12px;
      font-weight: 600;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      a {
        color: #003569;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    }
  }

  span {
    justify-self: end;
  }

  @media screen and (max-width: 900px) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-gap: 30px;
    align-items: center;
    ul {
      text-align: center;
    }
    span {
      justify-self: center;
    }
  }
`

export const Footer = () => {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear()

  return (
    <FooterWrapper>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to='/about'>About</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to='/help'>Help</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to='/privacy'>Privacy</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://reactgram.dev/" 
             target="_blank" 
             rel="noreferrer">
            Read the Book
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span className="subtitle">
        Â© {currentYear} Reactgram
      </span>
    </FooterWrapper>
  )
}
```

A few things to notice here:

* We didn't import React anymore at the top of our component. Since React 17
This isn't required anymore. It used to be required so the JSX transformer
would know which file to parse.

* We created a styled component called `FooterWrapper` which created a `footer`
HTML tag when it's rendered. This is handy when we want to create a more complex
component which can share its styles with its children. Notice the CSS we were
which targets `ul`, `li` and `span` elements.

* Within the `Footer` component, we added some new links to other static pages
we will be creating soon.

## Rendering child components

Now lets go ahead and use this component on our `StaticLayout.js` component. For that
we must do a little refactoring:

```jsx title="./src/components/static/StaticLayout.js"
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { Footer } from '../common/Footer';

const StaticLayoutWrapper = styled.div`
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
    justify-items: center;
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 935px;
    width: 100%;
`;

export const StaticLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return(
    <>
      <StaticLayoutWrapper>
        {children}
      </StaticLayoutWrapper>
      <Footer/>
    </>
  )
}
```

Here we used the same approach we took with the `Footer` component, using
a styled component as a wrapper and exporting the `StaticLayout` component
as usual.

There is one other thing we haven't seen yet:

* We are now passing a `prop` called `children` and within `StaticLayoutWrapper`
we are rendering it.

This is actually how you can make components more flexible and composable. Whenever
you need to render a nested component or HTML tag, you can accomplish via the `children`
prop which is automatically injected by React for you.

Now head back yo your browser. You should see something similar to this:

![About page with footer](/img/starting-reactgram/about-page-footer.png)

We now have a pretty decent footer that we can render across all pages of our app.
We also have links to other static pages that don't work yet. Let's build our Help and
Privacy pages in the next section.
