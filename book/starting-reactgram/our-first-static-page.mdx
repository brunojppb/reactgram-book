# Our first static page

Now that we have seen the building blocks of React, lets start building reactgram,
the app which give this book its title. You might ask yourself _"Is it really just 
Props and State all I need to know to build React apps?"_. Actually, most of it is 
directly connected with Props and State, although there is still a ton of things to 
learn in order to proper build React apps.But fear not, you will learn it as we apply 
the concepts while building reactgram.

We will start by creating the about page of Reactgram. This page is fairly static. It
contains some text and a link to the homepage. We will also using the same app template
we have been using from our previous chapters. We initially called it `hello-react`.
Feel free to rename the folder to `reactgram`, but that isn't required.

## Creating the about page

Let's restructure our app folder a little more. inside the `src` folder, create a new 
folder called `components`.

Now inside the `components` folder, create a new folder called `static`. This folder is 
meant for our static pages where each page is represented by a component. Now, inside 
the static folder, create a new file called `AboutPage.js` and lets add the following code:

```jsx title="/src/static/AboutPage.js"
import React from 'react';

function AboutPage() {

  return(
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>
        React is the most popular frontend library on the market. Built by Facebook, 
        it is based on functional components which are updated automatically when a state 
        update occurs. 
        Designed around a declarative architecture, components created in React are much 
        easier to build, debug and maintain.
      </p>
    </div>
  );

}

export default AboutPage;
```

## Navigating through pages in a SPA

We now have our first static page represented as a component. But a [few sections back](./hello-world/project-structure.md),
we briefly mentioned that a React app contains only one page, which is an `index.html` file.
With that in mind, how can we think about having multiple pages on a single-page application?

The secret of having pages in a single-page application relies in the [History API,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
which let us manipulate the URL we see in the browser and also the history stack, which allows
us to navigate back and forth without reloading the page. Implementing this behavior 
properly is quite a challenge, but thankfully the folks from [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/)
created the most popular library to manage routes. This library is called [React Router.](https://reactrouter.com/)
We will be using this library to help us structure our app pages.

## Starting with routes

To be able to guide the user through pages on our website, we need to tell the browser 
how to switch between routes. We start at `/` as the home page, but then when we click on a 
link pointing to `/about` you need to render a new page.

In classic server-side rendering apps, the link click triggers a request to the server, 
the server replies with a brand new page and then the browser renders it, replacing the 
previous page. When using React apps, we don't need this roundtrip. React apps are 
Single-page Applications, which means that all the pages are already there, we just need 
a way to switch routes without reloading the browser, but at the same time, keeping the URL 
in sync with the current page so your apps can still support links, just like any other 
website.

React doesn't include a routing mechanism, so we either have to implement it from scratch 
or use a library that does it for us. In our case, we will be using **React Router**. 
This library works exceptionally well for our use case. While implementing it, 
I will explain what each component of this library can help us with.

Lets install React Router in our app. Go to your terminal, stop the app and execute the 
following command:

```shell
yarn add react-router-dom
```

With React Router installed, start you app again with `yarn start`, go back to our 
`App.js` component and refactor it with the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import AboutPage from './components/static/AboutPage';

function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Reactgram</h1>
      <Router>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <AboutPage/>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now head back to your browser. You should see a link to the about page. 
if you click on it, you will notice that the header **Reactgram** still appears, 
but underneath it, the `<AboutPage/>` component immediately shows up. 
This is the magic React Router does for us. Let's take a step back to understand
what is going on here:

* The `<Router>` component: The original component name is actually __BrowserRouter__, 
but we just renamed it during the import statement for the sake of shorter names. 
The Router component must come somewhere at the top of our component tree. You will
understand why this component must be at the top of our component tree in the following
chapters. The most important thing to understand now is that its main responsibility 
is to control the URL behavior.

* The `<Link>` component: the classic `<a>` HTML tag is replaced by Link here for 
the sole reason that it will prevent the browser reloading the page and allows React 
Router to render the right component based on the URL path. It still renders an __a__ 
tag behind the curtains.

* The `<Switch>` component: It acts literally as context switcher. It requires `<Route>` 
components with a `to` prop as its children. It looks each Route component from top to 
bottom and check if the current URL in the path matches them. Once it finds the correct 
URL match, it will render the component specified by the `<Route>` component.

* The `<Route>` component: It acts as an auxiliary component for the Switch component 
we mentioned above, acting similarly as a __case__ clause in a JavaScript *__switch__* 
statement.
  
This is how it should look like on your browser:

![About page](/img/starting-reactgram/about-page-route.gif)

We now have the about page created. We also got a little glimpse on how routes are handled 
in our app. One thing you notice is that you will see this pattern over and over across 
the book.

Our new static page looks okay, but it's still missing styles. In the next section, 
we will add CSS and refactor it a bit to include a common component across all pages:
The footer of our website.
