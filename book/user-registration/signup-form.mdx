# Creating our signup form

After taking a tour on how to create static pages in our React app, now it's
to handle data submitted by our users and the traditional way to handle that 
is by using forms. When creating React apps, this is no different than other
apps.

In this section of the book, we will build the signup form where our users will
be able to create their account. During that part we will also cover how to
handle state while submitting forms and making API calls to our backend.

Here is how our homepage with the signup form will look like at the end of this
section:
