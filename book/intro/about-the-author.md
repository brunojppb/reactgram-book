Hi there ðŸ‘‹,  
__Bruno Paulino__ here.

I am originally from Brazil and I have been working in the IT field for more than 10 years.

I have worked and been working in interesting projects for several startups along those years.
Some interesting technologies I have been working recently are [the Scala language](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/), [Swift](https://swift.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).  

I am currently the Tech Lead of the Core Web platform at [N26](https://n26.com), a super cool company based in Vienna, Austria. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, hiking and traveling with my lovely wife.
I also enjoy teaching programming concepts and web development, so stay tuned for more cool programming content like this book in the near future.

You can find me on Twitter at [bpaulino0](https://twitter.com/bpaulino0) and [my personal website](https://bpaulino.com).  
Feel free to reach out.
