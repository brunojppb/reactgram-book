# Motivation to write this book

When I stumbled upon React, I was mainly developing native iOS apps and backend services. Once we had this need to build a back-office web application for our internal staff, so they could manage our orders, track shipping status, take quick actions if an order wasn't processed correctly, issue payment refunds and so on.

When I got this task, I had a good deal of web development under my belt, but I wasn't sure if using the battle-tested jQuery would be a fun work to do. I started researching on modern javascript frameworks and React was the number 1 on my results. Also, the community is really inspiring. You can find resources everywhere and people are always happy to help you on [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs) and Twitter.

[The official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) really shines here as well. You can get a grasp of the main concepts, test out code examples and see how they work in practice. Documentation is key in this rapid evolving javascript world, and the React team nailed it.

On the other hand, it was really hard to put all the pieces together. I could quickly figure out how to manage the component state, how props work and how to manage a component lifecycle. But how about putting together an entire application to run using React? how one goes to design the app in a way that supports user authentication, secure file uploads, protected routes and so on? Those "todo list apps" tutorials are great, but they can only go so far.

I decided to create an app from scratch using React where we can explore the whole design process, integration with backend, authentication mechanism, routes management and forms, but in a practical way. What if we learn React state management while creating an **instagram-like** post with a picture and a nice text that your followers can like and comment? This is the main goal of this book, to teach React while building a real world app that can be deployed to the cloud when we finish.

Learning to put this puzzle together was challenging and fun. It feels really productive writing javascript with React and that is why I decided to write this book. I want to give it back to the community, which helped and have been helping me a lot along the way.

The ability to build web apps with React is a super power. You can create truly dynamic applications that really feels like an app instead of bare web pages. So if you are interested into learning React, tag along and read the book.
