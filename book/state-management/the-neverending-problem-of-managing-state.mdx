# The never-ending problem of managing state

When you are building software, and I mean really any kind of software,
doesn't matter if it is a mobile app, native mac app or web app,
you have to deal with state management.

Things like keeping tracking if that little button was pressed, if that
ingredients list has all the right ingredients, if that timer is updating
the screen correctly every 5 seconds and this kind of stuff. And to keep
track of that, we usually come up with various ways to update the state and
keep track of its changes.

## React does it right

State management was the killer feature that drew my attention to React and
I believe that React does it right. The way it approaches state management
takes the following principle:

:::note State Management principle in React

Make your UI declarative and it will be kept in sync with your state by 
reacting to any state changes automatically.

:::

This notion might not make sense yet if you are not used it, but bear with me,
we will see examples of it and how incredible it feels to manage state in React.

I'm not here to say that React is the Holy Grail of state management, no there
are plenty of other libraries out there that do a decent job. Actually sometimes
you need a more complex state management library to help you with that, and that
can absolutely be used with React. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for example
is an excellent alternative.

But again, React itself is most probably more than enough for the apps you will
build.

## The built-in APIs are enough

Another strong point of React is that it provides native state management APIs
by default. You don't need an extra npm package or craft your own solution.

By composing components and sharing state between them, you will notice that
React owns APIs are more than enough for most apps, from small projects to
large codebases.

## Battle-tested developer tools

Another strong point from React is its developer tools. If you don't have that
installed yet, just go ahead and install it [from here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
We will demonstrate how to use this extension in the following chapters.
