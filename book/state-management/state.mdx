# State

With a good glimpse of how `props` work, what about state management? 
What does that even mean? Let's take a step back and understand what state is.

Let's say we need to develop an app that has a single button. 
This app must keep track of how many times the button has been 
clicked and show it on the screen.

We can call it __Counter App__. Let's go to our `hello-react` project and 
change our `src/App.js` file again with the following code:

```jsx title="./src/App.js"
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const count = 0;
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If we open our browser, we should be able to see this:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

```mdx-code-block

export function CounterApp1() {
  const count = 0;
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<BrowserWindow>
  <CounterApp1 />
</BrowserWindow>

```

If you click on the button, nothing will change. You might think:
_"Of course nothing changed, we need an event handler to listen for 
the button clicks"_. So let's hook up an event handler into our button.

```jsx title="./src/App.js"
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

export function App() {
  const count = 0;

  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    console.log('button was clicked');
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```mdx-code-block

export function CounterApp2() {
  const counter = 0;
  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    console.log('button was clicked');
  };
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {counter}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<BrowserWindow>
  <CounterApp2 />
</BrowserWindow>

```

The first thing we notice here is that React events are camelCase 
instead of the default lowercase API. instead `onclick` we used `onClick`
to pass our event handler function to the button. Now, if you open your 
browser console, you should see the event handler getting fired for 
every button click.


Yet so far, nothing has changed in the UI. But lets get back to our original 
question: How do I keep track of my counter? in other words, How can I 
keep track of the __state__ of my counter? We have declared a variable
called `count` within our component function body, but one thing we know
about function scopes is that whenever this function gets called, the `count`
variable is set again to `0`. How could we make that this variable can preserve
the state between function calls, in the React Component-land that roughly means
when a `render` cycle occurs.

## hooks

To solve this problem, React introduced a new concept called [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
This approach allow us to, within our component function body, declare state variables
and guarantee that they will be preserved between renders, unless we explicitly tell
them to change.

In this part of the book, we will see our fist hook in action. It's called `useState`.
There are many other React hooks that we will explore later on, but `useState` is by far
the most commonly used.
Lets refactor our component a little and see how that works:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    setCount(current => current + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now try to click on the **Increment Counter** button and see what happens.

```mdx-code-block


export function Counter3() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    setCount(current => current + 1);
  };
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<BrowserWindow>
  <Counter3/>
</BrowserWindow>
```

:::note Interactive Examples

This book is equipped with interactive examples like the one above.
You will notice that in some cases we will be able to interact with
the components we are writing along the book.

:::

Wait what? Our counter now is incrementing for every click and the UI 
updates immediately? That is the magic of React hooks. Even though our 
React component is a pure function, which means it doesn't mutate other 
objects, it still manages to keep track of our `count` variable. 
But how does that work? Let's take this code change we made a little further:

```jsx {5}
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    setCount(current => current + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the line highlighted above, we are using the [destructuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) 
to unpack two variables that come inside of the array returned by the `useState` 
function call. The first variable, `count` is the value we want to keep track of. 
It can be a number, a string, an object and any other data type we want. 
The second variable, in this case we called `setCount`, is the mutation function 
that allows us to update the state. We also pass a parameter to the `useState` call 
which is the initial state, in this case the number `0`. Now let's have a look at 
our event handler:

```jsx {7-9}
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

export function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onButtonClick = (event) => {
    setCount(current => current + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Current Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Increment Counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We can ignore the `event` object for now. Let's focus on the `setCount` function 
call. It receives a function as a callback that takes one parameter, the current 
state value that is passed in by React when this callback is called. This function 
we just passed as a callback also has to return something, which is the next 
desirable state. In our case, we just return the sum of the `current` value with 1 
to increment it. We are also using arrow functions to keep the code more lean.
You can [read a bit more about arrow functions here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)  

This is how React knows that the state has changed, and whenever it happens, it needs 
to update the UI. That is why you see the counter incrementing on the screen instantly.  
This is called [Reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html), which 
is an implementation of a diffing algorithm that figures out what has changed 
and updates only the necessary parts of the DOM tree.
  
That is how state works in React apps. The app we have built here might look very 
simplistic, but is enough to show you how simple state management can be in React.
We will see more examples in the next part, but that is enough to show you that 
State and Props are the building blocks of React apps.
