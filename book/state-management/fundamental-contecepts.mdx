# The fundamental concepts

Along this book, you will notice that we will be either repeating or
building on top of what we lean during the beginning of this book,
and that is by design.

The basic building blocks we need to build web apps with React are
remarkably simple. There are only three of them:

1. Components
2. Props
3. State

Will be exploring each one of them individually, but you have got a
taste of the first one in the previous chapters.

## Props

This concept is similar to HTML attributes. Lets say you have an 
`img` being rendered on the profile page of your app. This
`img` tag needs the `src` attribute so it can load the profile image.

Props work in a very similar fashion, the only difference is that
they are **immutable**, which means that when they once they are set,
they can't be modified. You might think that this isn't very useful
and I would agree with you. But React has an interesting way of
letting you update them by rendering a completely new version of your
component whenever you want to change props. We will see many examples
of props in practice along this book.

## State

While props are immutable, state was made to change over time. The
fundamental difference here is that you never mutate state objects
in React, but you pass in a new version of it whenever you need to
change it. We usually apply transformations on top of existing state
and generate a new version of it with what we need.

Think about a list of ingredients. Lets say you want to add a new
ingredient to this list. If you are using an `Array`, you would probably
say "Let's use `Array.push` to the new ingredient", but in React you
instead have to create a new array by combining the previous ingredients
with the newly added ingredient. That sounds like a lot of more work,
but the benefits that come with it will pay off.

## State and props in practice

Now that we introduced the basic building blocks of React, let's move
on and see how they work alongside each other.
