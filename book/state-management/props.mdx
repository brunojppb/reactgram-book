# Props

Just like we add the `src` property to an `img` tag, we can do the 
same with our custom React component. This is called `Props` in React 
and you can have your own custom ones. By default, if you add any property 
to a component, it will be the first parameter of the function, 
conventionally called `props`. It is an object that wraps all the custom 
properties you pass into your component. React incapsulates that in your 
function and let you handle that just like any other javascript function call.  
  
Lets change our `App` and `HelloWorld`components again, including the 
`props` argument and see what happens then.

```jsx title="./src/App.js"
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

export function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld firstName="Jill" />
    </div>
  );
}

export function HelloWorld(props) {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>My first name is {props.firstName}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We just added a prop called `firstName`. Now lets go to our browser 
and see what happens:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

```mdx-code-block

export function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld firstName="Jill" />
    </div>
  );
}

export function HelloWorld(props) {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>My first name is {props.firstName}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

<BrowserWindow>
  <App/>
</BrowserWindow>

```

Lets break it down:

- Our `HelloWorld` component now accepts a new property called `firstName` 
and this prop is a string. Notice that we used double quotation marks 
instead of curly brackets. This is due to the fact that you only need 
curly brackets if you want to inject javascript code, otherwise you 
can use the properties just like any normal HTML tag attribute.

- Inside our `HelloWorld` function, you see now the parameter called `props`.
With the props object, we have access to all the properties passed down from 
the parent component, in this case `App`.

## Inspecting the DOM

We created our React components and somehow it got rendered as valid HTML.
Lets open the browser inspector and see how our HTML looks like:

![Props browser inspector](/img/state-management/props-browser-inspector.png)

Notice that our components were rendered as HTML elements. you don't see a 
`<HelloWorld>` HTML tag there. The browser doesn't understand that. 
React abstracts away this complexity and creates the real DOM elements for us.

If we look closer, we can also see that the property `className="App"` 
was rendered as `class="App"`. This is also React doing its magic for us. 
Translating the javascript DOM API automatically to HTML attributes.
  
## Props and javascript expressions

Instead of just string literals like `firstName="Jill"`, we can also pass 
javascript expressions to component props. Lets try our passing an user 
object to `HelloWorld`:

```jsx
export function App() {

  const user = {
    firstName: 'Jill',
    lastName: 'Koh'
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld user={user} />
    </div>
  );
}

export function HelloWorld(props) {
  const {firstName, lastName} = props.user;
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>My name is {`${firstName} ${lastName}`}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You should be able to see the full user name on your browser:

```mdx-code-block

export function HelloUserWorld(props) {
  const {firstName, lastName} = props.user;
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>My name is {`${firstName} ${lastName}`}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

<BrowserWindow>
  <HelloUserWorld user={{firstName: 'Jill', lastName: 'Koh'}} />
</BrowserWindow>
```

There are three main differences in this snippet of code we should pay
attention to:

1. The `HelloWorld` component now accepts a `user` prop which is an object.
2. Inside `HelloWorld` we use the destructuring assignment syntax 
to unpack the user first and last name. You can read more about 
[destructuring assignment here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
3. Inside our `h2` we use the JSX syntax to write plain javascript code 
inside the curly braces.

With the example above, we can see that JSX is really powerful. It allows us 
to pass all kind of things down to our component three. It can be a string literal, 
an javascript object, an boolean, functions or even other React components.

In the next part we will see a bit more about props, but we will also dig a 
bit deeper into component state and how they play so nicely together.
