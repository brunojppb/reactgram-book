# Welcome to Reactgram

If you are a professional developer and want to get things done but is struggling to find a solid introduction to React with a more hands-on approach, you came to the right place.  

If you are a React beginner, fear not, I got you covered. This book focus on explaining the core fundamentals of React and only assumes you have [basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript](#), so no previous React knowledge is required.

We will create an **instagram-like** clone entirely from scratch using React. The app is called **Reactgram** and you can see a [__live demo here.__](https://app.reactgram.dev)  

There are plenty of books and tutorials out there that teaches React, and honestly most of them do a great job. The [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a great example of an amazingly well written material and it takes you quite far. But most of the time, the lack of context with a real-world application makes some concepts a bit hard to grasp. Usually the tutorials skip user authentication, protected routes and a bunch of other important parts from common applications you build during your day-to-day job.  

The book goal is to help you understand those concepts and put them in practice with a real application. Who here have never heard about the app called Instagram? I am sure that even if you don't have an instagram account, you are probably used to see their main functionality in other apps: Post pictures and share them with friends. So this is what we will build here. We won't include the full scope of the Instagram app like videos and stories, otherwise this book would be a billion pages long, but with what we will build together here you will get a good grasp of the building blocks that make this possible and might even build those features yourself as a stretch goal.  

So let's take a look at what kind of features we will build while reading the book and which React concepts we will learn to put them in practice.

## App Features

We will implement real-world functionalities that most of you have to build during your day-to-day job.
Those tasks encompass a decent level of complexity, but also with a good touch of real-life goals that you will probably face when working at your company or personal projects. We will see the following functionalities in action:

- User registration with sign-up
- User authentication with sign-in
- Upload pictures and create posts
- Delete posts
- Like posts
- Comment on posts
- Search for friends
- Follow and unfollow friends
- A dedicated page for user profile with recent posts
- Timeline with feed of posts
- Pagination when loading more posts
- Static pages
- Upload and update your own user profile and profile picture
- Update password
- Protect specific pages and only allow authenticated users to see

While we build this incredible app, we will learn the core fundamentals of React and more advanced concepts while we get the app done.
